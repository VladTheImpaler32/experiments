## One place to keep my adhd induced ideas, projects, and experiments 



### p5.js
A collection of random p5.js creations and ideas. Curious about physics simulations and generative art.

### matplotlib
trying to make a visual representation of sin and cos with python, realized there was a way easier way than I was trying to do it, and gave up 

### opencv 
a weeks worth of playing around with random opencv concepts and trying different things

### esp8266
really nothing, just a file needed for the opencv turret
