## One place to keep my adhd induced ideas, projects, and experiments 
### p5.js
A collection of random p5.js creations and ideas. Curious about physics simulations and generative art. Read about how each one works in the README within the p5js folder. See them [here](https://vladtheimpaler32.github.io/experiments/p5.js/) 
### OpenCV 
About a weeks worth of playing around with random opencv concepts and trying different things.
