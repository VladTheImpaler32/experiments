## One place to keep my adhd induced ideas, projects, and experiments 
### p5.js
A collection of random p5.js creations and ideas. Curious about physics simulations and generative art. Read about how each one works in the README within the p5js folder. See them [Here.](https://vladtheimpaler32.github.io/experiments/p5.js/) 
### OpenCV 
About a weeks worth of playing around with random opencv concepts and trying different things.
### Game Of Amazons
A vanilla javascript version of the Game of Amazons. Eventually will be multiplayer and maybe have a bot to play against. See it [Here.](https://vladtheimpaler32.github.io/experiments/js%20projects/Game%20of%20Amazons/amazons.html)
### Verlet Physics Engine
An extremely simple physics engine that was entirely inspired by [this](https://youtu.be/lS_qeBy3aQI) video. Just a quick 2 hour project that seemed pretty cool and not too difficult to make. It very quickly reaches the limits of javascript, though a more optimized collision detection algorithm would go a long way performance wise. See it [Here.](https://vladtheimpaler32.github.io/experiments/js%20projects/Verlet%20Physics/verlet.html)
