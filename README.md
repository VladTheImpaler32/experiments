### One place to keep my adhd induced ideas, projects, and experiments 

------------

#### matplotlib
trying to make a visual representation of sin and cos with python, realized there was a way easier way than I was trying to do it, and gave up 

------------
#### opencv 
a weeks worth of playing around with random opencv concepts and trying different things

------------

#### esp8266
really nothing, just a file needed for the opencv turret
