# p5.js

 ### Orbit
A conversion of a program I wrote in vanilla JavaScript. One gravity object in the center, a bunch of satellites that fly around/past it. Physics aren't realistic, just kind of cool to look at.
### Perlin Dots
My first p5.js program. The idea of generative art is quite cool to me and I wanted to learn a little more about Perlin noise so I made Perlin Dots. A grid of dots that uses Perlin noise as an offset to create a cool, flowing animation.
### Flow Field Particles
The particles move around according to a grid of vectors "beneath" them. The particles use the closest vectors direction and magnitude to update their acceleration and velocity. The vectors are created and updated with Perlin noise to create a flowing effect, color is of the particles is controlled by the same Perlin noise. 
### Boxes
Using Perlin noise to gradually change the rotation and translation of a grid of boxes to create a "falling" or "breaking" effect. Color also driven by Perlin noise.
