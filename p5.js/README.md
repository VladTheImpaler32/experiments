# p5.js

 ### Orbit
 A conversion of a program I wrote in vanilla JavaScript. One gravity object in the center, a bunch of satellites that fly around/past it. Physics aren't realistic, just kind of cool to look at.



### Perlin Dots
My first p5.js program. The idea of generative art is quite cool to me and I wanted to learn a little more about Perlin noise so I made Perlin Dots. A grid of dots that uses Perlin noise as an offset to create a cool, flowing animation.
